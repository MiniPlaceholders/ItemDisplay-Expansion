# ItemDisplay Expansion
ItemDisplay Expansion for MiniPlaceholders

This expansion only supports chat messages. If used anywhere else, it will not display the item.

```
<item_display_main_hand:(name)>
Displays the item that the player has in the main hand in chat.

<item_display_off_hand:(name)>
Displays the item that the player has in the off hand in chat.
```

The `name` argument is optional, here you can put a string which will be used to place the item in the chat.
By default, "item" will be used.
